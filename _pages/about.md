Hello, I'm Princess a first-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Danaë Metaxa](https://metaxa.net). My research broadly lives at the justice-oriented intersection of human-computer interaction and identity/marginalization. I study the construction and use of sociotechnical systems with lenses from Black feminism and queer of color critique. 

Prior to my PhD, I graduted from Spelman College with a B.S. in Computer Science. Additionally, I interned at Adobe Research, Etsy, and Amazon. These opportunities spanned qualitative HCI research on data storytelling and implementing data engineering workflows for advertising systems.

Current topics of interest: advertising systems, machine learning, algorithmic "fairness" and auditing, and tech-related pedagogical and policy interventions
