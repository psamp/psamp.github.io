I am a first-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania, advised by [Danaë Metaxa](https://metaxa.net). I am an alum of Spelman College, where I earned a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in comparative women's studies.

My research broadly lives at the justice-oriented intersection of human-computer interaction and identity/marginalization. By studying the construction and use of sociotechnical systems in conjuction with critical frameworks such as Black feminism and queer of color critique, I hope to advance a world where technology operating scale deepens human connection and autonomy rather than furthering systemic oppression and algorithmic harm. Current areas of interest include advertising systems, machine learning, design justice, and tech-related educational and policy interventions.

Prior to my PhD I interned at Adobe Research, Etsy, and Amazon. These opportunities spanned qualitative HCI research on data storytelling and implementing data engineering systems for advertising systems.
