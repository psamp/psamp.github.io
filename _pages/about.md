I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania in the Computer and Information Science department, advised by Prof. [Danaë Metaxa](https://metaxa.net). I am broadly interested in human-AI interaction, and particularly interested in the interplay between social structures and large-scale algorithmic infrastructure—especially as related to platform governance and the reduction of algorithmic harm. In my research, I build tools to support end-user autonomy and study marginalized people's experiences with algorithmic systems.

Beyond research, I serve as a chair of the Penn CIS Doctoral Association and a board member with the Penn Black Graduate Women's Association. Before Penn, I earned a B.S. in Computer Science (with a concentration in Gender Studies) from Spelman College. My prior work in industry spans software engineering, big data engineering, and HCI research at Amazon, Etsy, and Adobe Research.
