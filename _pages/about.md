I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania in the Computer and Information Science department, advised by Prof. [DanaÃ« Metaxa](https://metaxa.net). I am broadly interested in human-AI interaction, and in particular the interplay between the social structures and algorithmic infrastructure that shape daily life, work, and play at scale. In my research, I build human-centered and justice-oriented systems and study how marginalized people's experiences can inform platform governance.

Before Penn, I earned a BS in Computer Science (with a minor in Gender Studies) from Spelman College, and conducted research with Profs. [Munmun De Choudhury ](http://www.munmund.net/)and Jaye Nias. My prior work in industry spans software engineering, big data engineering, and HCI research at Amazon, Etsy, and Adobe Research.
