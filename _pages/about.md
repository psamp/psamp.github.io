I am a second-year PhD student in Penn's Department of Computer Science, advised by Prof. [Danaë Metaxa](https://metaxa.net). My broad interest is in human-AI interaction—especially questions of platform governance, content recommendation, and end-user wellbeing that emerge as social structures engage with large-scale algorithmic infrastructure. In my research, **I build tools for end-user autonomy and study how historically marginalized communities experience AI systems.**

Beyond research, I serve as a chair of the Penn CIS Doctoral Association and a board member with Penn's Black Graduate Women's Association. Before Penn, I earned a B.S. in Computer Science (with a concentration in Gender Studies) from Spelman College. My prior work in industry spans software engineering, big data engineering, and HCI research at Adobe Research, Amazon, and Etsy.
